'''There's more than one way to skin a cat'''. A problem often has more than one solution. This is certainly true with ChatScript. The purpose of the Practicum series is to show you how to think about features of ChatScript and what guidelines to follow in designing and coding your bot.

To glean is to extract information. If there is one thing that makes a chatbot seem intelligent it is the ability to grab information
from what the user says and make use of it in subsequent volleys. The very first chatbot, Eliza, fooled humans merely by grabbing
critical keywords from a user's input and spitting back precanned questions. If a user said "my wife is like my mother", Eliza could
focus on `like` and respond "In what way?" Or it could focus on the word mother and say "Tell me more about your mother". It did
not store information beyond the use for generating the reply. But our use of gleaning is to detect information and hold it around.

The process of coding gleaning takes the following steps. First, decide what you want to glean. Second, generate sample sentences
containing data to be gleaned. Typically 4 or 5. Third, write script to perform the gleaning. Fourth, decide how to store the results. Fifth,
find a way to make use of the gleaned data. Sixth, read logs, find new sentences you don't handle and handle them.

What you glean is up to you. Name, hobby, illnesses, favorite fruit, whatever. Let's consider gleaning information about 
a pet. You might want to glean kind of animal, name, breed, age, gender. Obviously first in line is gleaning kind of animal. 
To simplify things, we will start by only learning about pets of the speaker. If the user says "my friend has a dog", we won't care
(otherwise we have to master gleaning who owns the dog other than `I`).

# Gleaning animal type

We start with sample simple sentences. How might a user typically say they have a dog? 
```
I own a dog.
I have a puppy.
My dog is hungry.
I own a grey cocker spaniel.
```
These would be common ways to express ownership of a dog. There are also obscure ways, and at some point we will have to throw in
the towel and admit our program will not be perfect. Things like:
```
I possess a dog. 
I bought a dog the other day. 
I have raised this puppy from birth.
```

Taking our simple sentences, we then generate scripts to detect them. We need to decide what we are gleaning. I'm gleaning the kind of animal, in this case
always a dog. `puppy` is tied to age and `spaniel` is tied to breed.  The 3 key components of the pattern are detecting the animal
and the evidence of ownership and evidence of 'I-ness'. 

For now I will use rules that accept both statements and questions, because maybe the user will ask a question and reveal pet ownership like
"What should I feed my dog?"

### Sentence 1 "I own a dog."
```
u: OWN('I  own  a dog) $pet = dog
```
This covers my first sample. But it's very specific and won't handle `I own a black dog`. So I generalize it by allowing a few intervening words.
```
u: OWN('I  own *~4 dog) $pet = dog
```
I don't use the infinite wildcard `*` because I expect the word `dog` to be close. Infinite wildcards risk false detection.
My pattern avoids sentences like `I own a cat because I hate dogs.` Similarly I generalize between `'I` and `own` to catch `I already own a dog`.
```
u: OWN('I  *~2 own *~4 dog) $pet = dog
```

### Sentence 2 "I have a puppy"

To handle the next sample input, I need to detect `puppy` and `have`. I could write entirely new patterns, but that would become unwieldy to maintain.
And someday I'll want to detect other animals and breeds. So I create a concept to hold the dogs I want to detect, and I use the 
preexisting ChatScript concept for ownership (or else I could define a new one). While I show the concept next to the `u:`, in reality there would be some intervening
topic declaration.
```
concept: ~dogpet ( dog puppy)
u: OWN('I *~2  ~own *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
```


### Sentence 3 "my dog is hungry"

The third sentence requires a new pattern construction that simultaneously handles `I` and ownership.
```
concept: ~dogpet ( dog puppy)
u: OWN('I *~2  ~own *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
u: MY(my *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
```
Again I allow some space between `my` and `~dogpet` to support `my brown mangy dog`. From experience I know to allow for some intervening words all along.
Otherwise I'd write my pattern initially without and add generalization later.

### Sentence 4 "I own a grey cocker spaniel."

The fourth sentence requires detection of a dog breed. For that, we just add the corresponding CS concept to our `~dogpet`. Or invent a new one.
```
concept: ~dogpet ( dog puppy ~dog_breeds)
u: OWN('I *~2  ~own *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
u: MY(my *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
```

### Is your glean stable?

One flaw of all of the above rules is that they can change their mind about what pet is given. Probably it's better to insure
it stops after finding a pet. So I add `!$pet`.
```
concept: ~dogpet ( dog puppy ~dog_breeds)
u: OWN(!$pet 'I *~2  ~own *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
u: MY(!$pet my *~4 ~dogpet) $pet = dog
```

The above cannot handle the following volley input: "I own a pet. It is a dog." 
To handle that would require code to manage pronoun resolution. Also doable, but not in this lesson. 
But this example is extremely unlikely to be seen, so too bad.

## Expanding from dogs to all animals

And so we have simple detection of owning a dog. And if we want to expand this to handle other animals? We have to do two things.
First, expand (and rename) our pet concept. Second, save the right kind of pet animal. This will require memorizing the animal said,
and sometimes decoding it into the appropriate animal type. I use ^refine for that to keep the code clear.
```
concept: ~petlist ( ~animals puppy ~dog_breeds ~cat_breeds)
u: OWN(!$pet 'I *~2  ~own *~4 ~petlist) ^refine()
    a: ([_0==puppy _0?~dog_breeds _0==dog) $pet = dog
    a: ([_0==kitten _0?~cat_breeds _0==cat) $pet = cat
    a: () $pet = _0
u: MY(!$pet my *~4 ~dogpet) ^refine()
    a: ([_0==puppy _0?~dog_breeds _0==dog) $pet = dog
    a: ([_0==kitten _0?~cat_breeds _0==cat) $pet = cat
    a: () $pet = _0
```

### Using ^reuse

Something like above would do the job. But I repeated that ^refine for the MY rule and created code that is harder to maintain.
Rather than repeat the code, I would use `^reuse` like this:
```
concept: ~petlist ( ~animals puppy ~dog_breeds ~cat_breeds)
u: OWN(!$pet 'I *~2  ~own *~4 ~petlist) ^refine()
    a: ([_0==puppy _0?~dog_breeds _0==dog) $pet = dog
    a: ([_0==kitten _0?~cat_breeds _0==cat) $pet = cat
    a: () $pet = _0
u: MY(my *~4_ ~petlist) ^reuse(OWN)
```

But that won't work if I have text to also send to the user as in below, because we get the dog message as well as the cat message.
```
u: OWN(!$pet 'I *~2  ~own *~4 _~petlist) ^refine() I love dogs.
    a: ([_0==puppy _0?~dog_breeds _0==dog) $pet = dog
    a: ([_0==kitten _0?~cat_breeds _0==cat) $pet = cat
    a: () $pet = _0
u: MY(!$pet my *~4 _~petlist) ^reuse(OWN) I love cats.
```

### Placeholder rules - s: LABEL(?)

To fix our problem,  create a placeholder rule to ^reuse that says nothing and can't be triggered accidently.
```
concept: ~petlist ( ~animals puppy ~dog_breeds ~cat_breeds)
u: OWN(!$pet 'I *~2  ~own *~4 _~petlist) ^reuse(SAVEPET) I love dogs.
u: MY(!$pet my *~4 _~petlist) ^reuse(SAVEPET) I love cats.
s: SAVEPET(?) ^refine() 
    a: ([_0==puppy _0?~dog_breeds _0==dog) $pet = dog
    a: ([_0==kitten _0?~cat_breeds _0==cat) $pet = cat
    a: () $pet = _0
```
The SAVEPET placeholder rule never triggers on its own, because it requires the input to be both a statement (s:) and a question (?). Won't happen.
And the SAVEPET rule is given in _0 the matched animal from either rule calling it.

OK. We have detected one animal type. Now, do we go on to more data about it or do we work on someone who owns multiple animals?
I'd move on to more data because our chatbot can appear smart merely recognizing one. And writing patterns to detect multiple
instances is more complex. And writing where to store the answer is more complex.

# Gleaning animal gender

We start the same way, deciding sample sentences.
```
I have a female golden retriever.
My cow is hungry. 
My cat is grey and he lives outdoors.
My cat is grey. He lives outdoors.
```

While I could stumble my way through a bunch of iterations, let me just jump to how I think the answer goes.
```
concept: ~femaleness (she her female cow)
concept: ~maleness (he him male bull)
...old code for detecting animal type ...
u: ($pet ~femaleness) $petgender = female
u: ($pet ~maleness) $petgender = male
```
The above gets us gender in most situations. We require that a pet has been detected already. While seeing a gender pronoun
in a later sentence is common, one does not typically see one before the item referred to. You won't likely see "she loves milk does my cat"
but you could see "my cat she does love milk"

We don't care if the gender marker
has occured in the same sentence or a later one. It's a start. Then we have to think of inputs we can get fooled by.
We will be fooled by inputs that involve gender but not of our pet, like `My dog was sick so my sister was sad and she said so.`
For now I don't care. In advanced code we could handle this. Similarly it will be a lot of work to correctly distinguish 
"Harold has a cat who scratched him" and "Harold has a cat who scratched himself". So we won't bother. We will tolerate errors
to get it right most of the time.

# Preventing false positives

Gleaning from specific words or phrases (concept sets) is easy. The hardest thing is to avoid false positives, where the
keyword doesn't mean what you think it does. There are two ways to handle this. 

### Using ^refine

The first is to use '^refine' and something like `@_0+` to exclude some matches.
```
u: (!$pet _~petanimals) ^refine() ^retry(RULE)
    #! My teenager is feeling puppy love -- dont react
    #! he still has puppy fat in his cheeks -- don't react
    a: (@_0+ [love fat])      
    #! you'd have to be one sick puppy to want to go to the hospital -- dont react
    a: (@_0- sick)      
    a: () $pet = _0  
)
```
The above has the advantage of entirely local code- it's clear and you know where to modify things. It keeps scanning the sentence 
until $pet has be set or matches run out. It is also faster and easier to read in traces, because if the main pattern doesnt match, you 
never have to try all the rejoinder rules.

### Using ^unmark

The alternative is to hide ~petanimals from matching. This would be good if there are several rules depending upon it. You would do that like
this:
```
#! My teenager is feeling puppy love -- dont react
#! he still has puppy fat in his cheeks -- don't react
u: NOTPUPPY (_~petanimals [love fat]) 
    ^unmark(~petanimals _0)
    ^retry(RULE)
#! you'd have to be one sick puppy to want to go to the hospital -- dont react
u: NOTPUPPY(_~petanimals @_0- sick)   
     ^unmark(~petanimals _0)
    ^retry(RULE)
```
The above hides inappropriate detections of ~petanimals, leaving only the valid ones. It is better to use ^unmark on the specific
concept rather than doing `^unmark(* _0)` because making the word completely invisible can have unintended other consequences. 
But the above is messier, slower, uses more code, and generates more trace than this equivalent:
```
u: NOTPUPPY (_~petanimals) ^refine() ^retry(RULE)
    #! My teenager is feeling puppy love -- dont react
    #! he still has puppy fat in his cheeks -- don't react
    a: (@_0+ [love fat]) ^unmark(~petanimals _0)  
    #! you'd have to be one sick puppy to want to go to the hospital -- dont react
    a: (@_0- sick)  ^unmark(~petanimals _0) 
```

So mostly I think using ^refine is better than multiple top-level rules.

# Gleaning names

Some things you need to glean will not show up in a concept set, or may only partially. The classic example is gleaning a name.
It can be any word or sequence of words and what you usually have to detect is the context bounding the name. You have to start making
assumptions about what a reasonable name will consist of. So, as always, first write sample inputs, then make patterns for them.
```
His name is Roger.
we call him rabbit.
HE IS CALLED HAROLD THE MAGNIFICENT AND IS 12.
My cat Harold likes birds.
```

So we start with the first sentence.
```
u: (name is _~noun_proper_singular)
```

The above is simple, but will fail when the system doesnt know the name. Like for "His name is pansy." So maybe we also need a context dependent rule.
```
u: NAMEIS(name _is) ^refine()
    a: CONCEPTNAME(@_0+ _~noun_proper_singular) $petname = '_0'
    a: CONTEXTNAME(@_0+  _*~3 [> , ~conjunction])  $petname = '_0
```
Note here we don't want the canonical of the name, we want the actual name, so we use quoted _0.
The CONTEXTNAME pattern assumes names are usually 3 or fewer in length and are bounded by some typical delimiter like end of sentence,
comma or `and`. It would fail for `Her name is Little Red Riding Hood`, unless the user is using capital letters meaningfully and proper name merging is on. We could
increase the wildcard to `*~4`. But the wider we make that wildcard, the more room for mischief. "My name is something my mother liked."

And we can extend the rule to handle `called` like this: 
```
u: NAMEIS(name _is) ^refine()
    #! his name is Peter
    a: CONCEPTNAME(@_0+ _~noun_proper_singular) $petname = '_0'
    #! his name is master of all.
    a: CONTEXTNAME(@_0+  _*~3 [> , ~conjunction])  $petname = '_0
#! he is called Roger
u: CALLED( is _called) ^refine(NAMEIS)  
#!  we call it Roger
u: CALLED1( 'call _[him her it] ) ^reuse(NAMEIS) 
```

And we can handle an appositive name like this:
```
#! my cat Harold the Great jumped from the roof
u: APPOSITIVE(~petanimals _*~3 ~verb)    
```

# Understanding meaning is hard

Obviously we can devise sentences where all these things fail. Language is difficult. I mean, if I say
"my feline harold who likes birds kills snakes."  Is it a cat? What is the name of the cat?
Is it Harold or is it some Indian name like "Harold who likes birds"? What you need to do is make assumptions and then
also write code where the user can correct you when you get it wrong.
